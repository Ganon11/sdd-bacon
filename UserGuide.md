# Introduction #

This is a short introduction to BACON, meant for first time users.  If you have used BACON for a while, you probably don't need to read this!



## How To Add Comics ##

If you are running BACON for the first time, you probably don't have a comic list built yet, and BACON will load up displaying a blank screen.<br>

5) Fill in the Comic Name and Comic Author.  If you don't know the author, you can leave it blank; however, some features (such as Sorting by Author Name) may not work as expected.<br>

<b><code>*</code> For example, the webcomic CTRL+ALT+DEL has a main page of <a href='http://www.cad-comic.com/'>http://www.cad-comic.com/</a>.  However, this is not where the latest webcomic is displayed.  The latest comic is displayed at the URL <a href='http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/'>http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/</a>.  You should give BACON the second example, not the first example.</b><br>

<h2>How To Remove Comics</h2>

Removing comics from your database is simple!  Just scroll to the desired comic in the main window, then right-click on the comic image.<br>

Select Remove Comic.<br>

And you're done!  The comic has been removed from your database, and will not be displayed again until you add it again.<br>

<h2>How To Edit Comics</h2>

BACON operates on the assumption that Web Comic Authors will keep their websites organized in the same fashion from day to day.  However, there are times when authors re-arrange their websites.  This may cause BACON to malfunction.  In order to fix these web comics, you will need to edit the webcomic.<br>

1) Scroll to the comic you need to edit.<br>
2) Right click on the comic image.<br>
3) Select Edit Comic.  The Add Comic Dialog will open with the selected Web Comic's information already loaded.<br>

4) Change the Comic details so that they are correct, and click Accept.<br>

Your changes will be saved in the Comic Database, and the webcomic will display correctly until the Web Comic Author changes his/her website again.
