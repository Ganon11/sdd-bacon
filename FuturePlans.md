# Introduction #

BACON was conceptualized, designed, and written for the course Software Design and Documentation at <a href='http://www.rpi.edu'>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> (RPI).  We planned a certain set of features to focus on completing for the course, explicitly neglecting to add certain other features.  Some of the features we had planned to do could not be completed.


Any plans we have for future versions of BACON will be listed here.  If you have suggestions for new features, please e-mail us at sdd.bacon@gmail.com, and we will do our best to incorporate good ideas.


## Future Features ##

V1.1 Enhancements
  * Downloading images to the user's computer, and referencing these images rather than URLs
  * Adding the ability to sort by update status (i.e. recently updated comics show up before non-updated comics)
